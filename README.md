## Next steps

Here are some things I'd like to work on:

### Improvements on existing functionality
- Improve cross browser compatibility with CSS - eg current flexbox grid approach in header will be buggy on IE
- Style the search page

### New functionality
- Display movies with more meta data and the movie poster in a responsive grid
- Introduce tv show and people data models / components to be able to consume the [multi search endpoint](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/images)
- Create a "detailed" display when a user clicks on a specific movie / item

### Technical improvements
- Introduce Cypress to write functional tests
- SSR the application
